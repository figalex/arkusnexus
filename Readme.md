## PageSpeed Optimization

This is the result of pagespeed modifications applied to the arkusnexus website. 

### Performance as UX
>Adding half a second to a search results page can decrease traffic and ad revenues by 20 percent, according to a Google study. The same article reports Amazon found that **every additional 100 milliseconds of load time decreased sales by 1 percent**. Users expect pages to load in two seconds, and **after three seconds, up to 40 percent will simply leave**.
